#Snake game!

##Small game

- Doing this small python project to learn some more python
- Why? Because it's fun :)

##Cool, how do I run it?

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the game by running `python3 pysnakegame.py`

You may need to install python, and use pip to create a virtualenv in case you need the packages used

In that case:

1. Python: https://www.python.org/
