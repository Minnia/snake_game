#Snake game!

##Small game

- Doing this small python project to learn some more python
- Why? Because it's fun :)

##Cool, how do I run it?

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the game by running `python3 pysnakegame.py`

You may need to install python, and use pip to create a virtualenv in case you need the packages used

In that case:

1. Python: https://www.python.org/

##Creating your own virtualenv:

1. Check that you have virtualenv installed with the command `which virtualenv`
2. If you have it installed: create your own virtualenv with `virtualenv <my_env_name>`
3. If you don't have it installed: install with pip by running `python -m pip install virtualenv`
4. Install packages used for the game (`pygame` and `time`)
